Begin_with_Sockets
==================

My First Project with Socket.io

## If you want to use it

Be sure you have NodeJS on your computer, if not go [there](http://nodejs.org/).

Then go in the directory and run : 

```
npm intall
node app.js
```


##Features

A chat system with web sockets.

And a drawing system using canvas and web sockets.
