Begin_with_Sockets
==================

My First Project with Socket.io

## If you want to use it

Be sure you have NodeJS on your computer, if not go [there](http://nodejs.org/).

Then go in the directory and run : 

```
npm intall express
npm intall jade
npm intall socket.io
node app.js
```


And enjoy the chat!
